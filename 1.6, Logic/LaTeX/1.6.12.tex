	\begin{theorem*}[1.6.12]
		The product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.
	\end{theorem*}
	
	\begin{proof}
		For the purpose of contradiction, suppose that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is rational. This can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b} \space \cdot \space x = \frac{c}{d}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are integers and $x$ is irrational. Since $a \neq 0$ we equivalently have $x = \frac{c}{d} \space \cdot \space \frac{b}{a} = \frac{cb}{da}$. A contradiction.
