	\begin{theorem*}[1.6.16]
		Let m and n be integers. If the product mn is even, then m is even or n is even.
	\end{theorem*}
	
	\begin{proof}
		By the contrapositive. Suppose the negation of the consequent; that is, $m$ is odd and $n$ is odd. By definition, there exist integers $k$ and $j$ such that $m = 2k + 1$ and $n = 2j + 1$. Thus, $mn = (2k + 1)(2j + 1) = 2(kj + k + j) + 1$. The factor $kj + k + j$ is an integer, and so the product $mn$ is odd by definition.
	\end{proof}
