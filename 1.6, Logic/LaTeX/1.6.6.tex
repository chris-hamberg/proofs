	\begin{theorem*}[1.6.6]
		The product of two odd numbers is odd.
	\end{theorem*}
	
	\begin{proof}
		Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are odd numbers. By definition, there exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that $x = 2m + 1$ and $y = 2n + 1$. $xy = (2m + 1)(2n + 1) = 2m2n + 2m + 2n + 1 = 2(mn + m + n) + 1$. $mn + m + n$ is an integer because the sum of integers is an integer. Thus, xy is odd by definition.
	\end{proof}
