	\begin{theorem*}[2.4.37]
		Let A, and B be sets such that $A \subseteq B$. If A is \newline uncountable, then B is uncountable.
	\end{theorem*}
	
	\begin{proof}
		By the hypothesis, $|A| > \aleph_0$ by the definition for countability since $A$ is uncountable. By the definition for subset, the cardinality of $B$ is at least the cardinality of $A$. Therefore the least cardinality for $B$ is $|B| > \aleph_0$, and it follows that $B$ is uncountable.
	\end{proof}
