	\begin{theorem*}[1.6.10]
		The product of two rational numbers is rational.
	\end{theorem*}
	
	\begin{proof}
		Let $m$ and $n$ be rational numbers. By definition there exist integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such 
		that $m = \frac{a}{b}$ and $n = \frac{c}{d}$. The product of $m$ and $n$ is $\frac{ac}{bd}$. Since 
		the product of integers is an integer, $ac$ and $bd$ are integers. Thus $mn$ is rational by 
		definition.
	\end{proof}
