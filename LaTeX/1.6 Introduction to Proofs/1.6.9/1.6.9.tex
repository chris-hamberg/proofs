	\begin{theorem*}[1.6.9]
		The sum of an irrational number and a rational number is irrational.
	\end{theorem*}
	
	\begin{proof}
		By contradiction. Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are rational numbers. By definition, there exist integers
		$a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such that $m = \frac{a}{b}$ and $n = \frac{c}{d}$. Let $x$ be an irrational 
		number such that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number can be expressed as 
		$m + x = n$ and $n + (-m) = x$. In terms of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ we have 
		$\frac{-a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{-ad}{bd} + \frac{cb}{bd} = \frac{-ad + cb}{bd} = x$. Note that 
		the sum of products of integers is an integer. But this is impossible because $x$ is irrational; 
		thus a contradiction.
	\end{proof}
