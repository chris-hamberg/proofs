\begin{theorem} %[\textbf{1603}]
    If \bm{$\chi$} is an even integer, 
    then \bm{$\chi^2$} is an even integer.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    By the definition for even numbers, 
    there exists an integer \bm{$\eta$} such that 
    \bm{$\chi = 2\eta$}. 
    Hence,
    \begin{equation*}
        \big \langle 2 \eta \big \rangle ^2 
            = 
        4 \eta ^2 
            = 
        2 \big \langle 2 \eta ^2 \big \rangle
    \end{equation*}
    Integers are closed under multiplication. 
    Thus, the factor 
    \bm{$\big \langle 2 \eta ^2 \big \rangle$} is an integer. 
    It follows that \bm{$\chi^2$} is even, by 
    the definition for even numbers.
