\begin{theorem} %[\textbf{1605}]
    Let \bm{$\mu$}, \bm{$\zeta$}, and \bm{$\pi$} be integers. 
    If \bm{$\mu + \zeta$} and \bm{$\zeta + \pi$} are even, 
    then \bm{$\mu + \pi$} is even.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    By the hypothesis, 
    there exist integers \bm{$\sigma$} and \bm{$\epsilon$} such that 
    \bm{$\mu + \zeta = 2\sigma$}, 
    and \bm{$\zeta + \pi = 2\epsilon$}. 
    Hence, 
    \begin{equation*}
        \big \langle \mu + \zeta \big \rangle 
            + 
        \big \langle \zeta + \pi \big \rangle
            = 
        2 \sigma + 2 \epsilon
    \end{equation*}
    Subtracting \bm{$2\zeta$} from both sides, 
    by the subtraction property of equality for equations, 
    produces
    \begin{equation*}
        \Big \langle \mu + \pi \Big \rangle
            = 
        \Big \langle 2 \sigma + 2 \epsilon - 2 \zeta \Big \rangle
            = 
        \Big[ 2 \big \langle \sigma + \epsilon - \zeta \big \rangle \Big]
    \end{equation*}
    \bm{$\sigma$} and \bm{$\epsilon$} are integers,
    by the definition for even numbers, 
    and \bm{$\zeta$} is an integer by the hypothesis. 
    Since addition and subtraction are closed on integers, 
    the factor 
    \bm{$\big \langle \sigma + \epsilon - \zeta \big \rangle$} 
    is an integer. 
    It follows that \bm{$\mu + \pi$} is an even, 
    by the definition for 
    even numbers.
