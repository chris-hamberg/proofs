\begin{theorem} %[\textbf{1609}]
    The sum of an irrational number and a rational number is irrational.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    By contradiction. Suppose that \bm{$\mu$} and \bm{$\zeta$} are rational numbers, 
    and let \bm{$\chi$} be an irrational number. 
    For the purpose of contradiction, 
    assume the negation of the hypothesis. 
    That is, the proposition 
        $$\lnot p: \emph{the sum of an irrational number and a rational number 
        is rational.}$$
    Hence, \bm{$\chi + \mu = \zeta$}, 
    by the assumption \bm{$\lnot p$}. 
    Thus, 
    \bm{$\chi = \zeta + \big \langle - \mu \big \rangle$}, 
    by the additive equality property for equations. 
    But rational numbers are closed under addition by the closure property for rational numbers. 
    So \bm{$\lnot p$} implies \bm{$\chi$} is rational, 
    and \bm{$\chi$} is irrational; a contradiction.
