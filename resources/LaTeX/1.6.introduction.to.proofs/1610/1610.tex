\begin{theorem} %[\textbf{1610}]
    The product of two rational numbers is rational.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let \bm{$\mu$} and \bm{$\zeta$} be rational numbers. 
    By the definition for rational numbers, 
    there exist integers \bm{$\alpha$}, \bm{$\beta$}, \bm{$\gamma$}, and \bm{$\delta$} such that 
    \bm{$\mu \textbf { = } \frac{\alpha}{\beta}$} and \bm{$\zeta \textbf { = } \frac{\gamma}{\delta}$}. 
    The product of \bm{$\mu$} and \bm{$\zeta$} is \bm{$\frac{\alpha\gamma}{\beta\delta}$}. 
    Since integers are closed under multiplcation, 
    \bm{$\alpha\gamma$} and \bm{$\beta\delta$} are integers. 
    Thus \bm{$\mu\zeta$} is rational by definition.
\end{proof}
