\begin{theorem} %[\textbf{1625}]
    There does not exist a rational number \bm{$\rho$} such that 
    \bm{$\rho^3 + \rho + 1 = 0$}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    For the purpose of contradiction, 
    assume that there exists a rational number \bm{$\rho$} satisfying the equation \bm{$\rho^3 + \rho + 1 = 0$}. 
    By the definition for rational numbers, 
    there exist integers \bm{$\alpha$} and \bm{$\beta$} (\bm{$\beta$} is nonzero,) such that 
    \begin{equation*}
        \left( 
            \rho ^3 + \rho + 1 
        \right) 
            = 
        \left( 
            \frac{\alpha^3}{\beta^3} + \frac{\alpha}{\beta} + 1 
        \right) 
            = 
        0
    \end{equation*}
    By the additive equality property for equations, that is
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{\alpha^3}{\beta^3} 
            = 
        \left(
            -1 - \frac{\alpha}{\beta}
        \right)
    \end{equation*}
    It is possible to derive \bm{$\rho^2$} from \bm{$\rho^3$} 
    by multiplying \bm{$\rho^3$} by the multiplicative inverse for \bm{$\rho$}. 
    By the multiplicative equality property for equations,
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{\alpha^3}{\beta^3} \cdot \frac{\beta}{\alpha}
            =
        \left(
            -1 - \frac{\alpha}{\beta}
        \right) 
            \cdot 
        \frac{\beta}{\alpha} 
            =
        \left\{
            \frac{-\beta}{\alpha} 
                - 
            \frac{\alpha \beta}{\beta \alpha}
        \right\}
    \end{equation*}
    Thus, by the field axioms, \bm{$\rho^2$} is
    \begin{equation*}
        \left\{
            \frac{-\beta}{\alpha} 
                - 
            \frac{\alpha \beta}{\beta \alpha}
        \right\}
            = 
        \left(
            \frac{-\beta - \alpha}{\alpha}
        \right)
            = 
        -1 
            \cdot 
        \left( 
            \frac{\beta + \alpha}{\alpha}
        \right)
    \end{equation*}
    Applying the square root to \bm{$\rho^2$} gives the identity for \bm{$\rho$}
    \begin{equation*}
        \sqrt{ \frac{\alpha^2}{\beta^2} } 
            =
        \sqrt{ -1 \cdot \left( \frac{\beta + \alpha}{\alpha} \right) } 
            =
        i \cdot \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\beta + \alpha}{\alpha} \right) }
    \end{equation*}
    \bm{$\rho$} is imaginary and rational. 
    Thus, the negation of the hypothesis implies a contradiction. 
    In other words, \bm{$\rho$} does not exist.
