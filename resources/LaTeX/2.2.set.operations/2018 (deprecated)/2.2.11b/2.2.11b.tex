	\begin{theorem*}[2.2.11b]
		Let A and B be sets. The intersection of A and B is commutative.
	\end{theorem*}
	
	\begin{proof}
		Let $x$ be an element in $A \cap B$. By the definition of intersection, $(x \in A) \land (x \in B)$. 
		Because logical conjunction is commutative, the definition is equivalently stated as 
		$(x \in B) \land (x \in A)$. Meaning that $x \in (B \cap A)$. So $A \cap B = B \cap A$, and indeed 
		the intersection of two sets is commutative.
	\end{proof}
