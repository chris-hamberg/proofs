	\begin{theorem*}[2.2.38a]
		Let A, and B be sets. The symmetric difference of sets is associative such that 
		$(A \oplus B) = (B \oplus A)$.
	\end{theorem*}
	
	\begin{proof}
		By Theorem 2.2.35, $A \oplus B = (A \cup B) - (A \cap B)$. Because set union is 
		associative, and because set intersection is associative, we have 
		\newline $(B \cup A) - (B \cap A)$. Again, according to Theorem 2.2.35, that is 
		$B \oplus A$.
	\end{proof}
