\begin{theorem*}[\textbf{2368}]
    Let \bm{$\lambda$} be a function 
    \bm{$\lambda : \mathrm{A} \rightarrow \Lambda$}, 
    where \bm{$\mathrm{A}$} and \bm{$\mathrm{\Lambda}$} are finite sets, 
    and \bm{$|\mathrm{A}| = |\Lambda|$}. 
    \bm{$\lambda$} is injective 
    if and only if 
    \bm{$\lambda$} is surjective.
\end{theorem*}

\begin{proof}
    Direct form by the contrapositive. 
    Suppose \bm{$\lambda$} is not surjective. 
    This can be true only if \bm{$|\mathrm{A}| < |\Lambda|$} (which is impossible,) 
    or when \bm{$\lambda$} is not injective.
    Thus, if \bm{$\lambda$} is injective, then \bm{$\lambda$} is surjective.

    Converse form by the contrapositive. Suppose \bm{$\lambda$} is not injective.
    This can be true only if \bm{$|\mathrm{A}| > |\Lambda|$} (which is impossible,) 
    or when \bm{$\lambda$} is not surjective. 
    Thus, if \bm{$\lambda$} is surjective, then \bm{$\lambda$} is injective.
