\begin{theorem}[\textbf{2437}]
    Let \bm{$\mathrm{A}$}, and \bm{$\Lambda$} be sets such that 
    \bm{$\mathrm{A}$} is a subset of \bm{$\Lambda$}. 
    If \bm{$\mathrm{A}$} is uncountable, 
    then \bm{$\Lambda$} is uncountable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Direct proof.
    The cardinality for \bm{$\mathrm{A}$} is greater than \bm{$\aleph_0$},
    by the definition for countability. 
    By the definition of subsets, 
    the cardinality of \bm{$\Lambda$} is at least the cardinality 
    of \bm{$\mathrm{A}$}. 
    Hence, \bm{$\Lambda$} is uncountable, by the definition for countability.
\end{proof}
